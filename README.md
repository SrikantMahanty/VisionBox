# VisionBox

VisionBox is an Android application designed for object recognition using advanced image processing and AI models. 📸🤖 The app leverages the device's camera to identify objects in real time and display the results on the screen.

## Features
- **Object Recognition:** Recognizes and labels objects in the camera feed. 🏷️
- **Camera Integration:** Seamless interaction with the device's camera. 📷
- **Customizable Colors:** Highlights objects with distinct colors for better visualization. 🎨
- **Power Management:** Utilizes wake locks to ensure uninterrupted performance during scanning. 🔋
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for ease of use. 🖥️
